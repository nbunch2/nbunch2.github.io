<p>The company logo and slogan will be placed at the top and throughout the website. The business identity will relate to customers since it is a company created by college students, aiming towards college students</p>

<p>Jquery modules will be included in the site for consistent navigation bar and footer. There will be few dropdown menus so that it is easy to navigate. The navigation titles will be one word each so that it is easy for the customer to know what each page does. There will also be a hover effect and change of color when consumers are on certain pages so that they know which page they are currently on. </p>

<p>The main headings will be with sans serif, thin lettering and short. The body copy will consist of short paragraphs, when needed. For the most part, a lot of the information will be shown through pictures so that the information doesn’t look overwhelming to read and the customers will be able to get the information fast. </p>
