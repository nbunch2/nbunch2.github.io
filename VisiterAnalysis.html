				<h2>Visitor Analysis</h2>
                <p>The demographics of this website are college students, ages 18 to around 25 attending BYU-Idaho in Rexburg, Idaho. This site met the needs of this demographic becasue it states clearly at the top a scripture and continues down the main page by talking about how the Nauvoo house apartments are right for them. This site was very easy to navigate. The main page had mostly information about the apartment complex, it's purpose and how it can help the demographic. in the top righthand corner it was easy to see the navigation bar. This navigation bar had very clear, one-word linds such as sign up or pay rent. It was easy to enter and complete the task I went in to do which was to sign a contract. </p>
        
				<p>The experience was easy. It was very clear that the purpose of the homepage was to entice future contract-signers and that the navigation bar was to assist current residents. THere were very few colors, fast-loading pictures and simple navigation. The paragraphs were all in alignment and that made it simple to complete the task</p>
                
                <p>The simple, fast set up of the website definitely appealed to the age and target market of the website. Usually, if a person is visiting the site, they are doing it to find quick information. They want to know what the apartment complex offers, how much it is and where it is located. They wat to see fun and socializing. Most likely, if the user is on a mobile device on this site they are on the go. Most students will look at the site in a browser since it is easier to naviagte, make payments and sign contracts. They want to know why, how, and for how much they can sign up for. They are most likely students that already attend BYU-Idaho since it isn't freshman housing. THey did a good job of making this mobile site simple and fast. </p>
