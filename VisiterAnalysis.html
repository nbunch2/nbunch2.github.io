				<h2>Visitor Analysis</h2>
                <p>The demographics of this website are college students, ages 18 to around 25 attending BYU-Idaho in Rexburg, Idaho. This site met the needs of this demographic becasue it states clearly at the top a scripture and continues down the main page by talking about how the Nauvoo house apartments are right for them. This site was very easy to navigate. The main page had mostly information about the apartment complex, it's purpose and how it can help the demographic. in the top righthand corner it was easy to see the navigation bar. This navigation bar had very clear, one-word linds such as sign up or pay rent. It was easy to enter and complete the task I went in to do which was to sign a contract. </p>
        
				<p>The experience was easy. It was very clear that the purpose of the homepage was to entice future contract-signers and that the navigation bar was to assist current residents. THere were very few colors, fast-loading pictures and simple navigation. The paragraphs were all in alignment and that made it simple to complete the task</p>
                
                <p>The simple, fast set up of the website definitely appealed to the age and target market of the website. Usually, if a person is visiting the site, they are doing it to find quick information. They want to know what the apartment complex offers, how much it is and where it is located. They wat to see fun and socializing. Most likely, if the user is on a mobile device on this site they are on the go. Most students will look at the site in a browser since it is easier to naviagte, make payments and sign contracts. They want to know why, how, and for how much they can sign up for. They are most likely students that already attend BYU-Idaho since it isn't freshman housing. THey did a good job of making this mobile site simple and fast. </p>

				<h2>Persona</h2>
				<!--Add paragraphs to address the items in the persona reading to build a persona for this site-->
                <p> A typical persona for a user on this website would be a second-semester student at BYU-Idaho. She is trying to find houseing for her third semester and she heard that Nauvoo house is a very social apartment complex that often has social events and close-knit wards. She diecides to visit the website to learn more. Most likely, she will be going to the website to find proof of these social events and additional information about the complex amenities. This would define the most valuable persona to the website as a future resident. </p>
				<p>The users expectations as they enter the site would be a transparent description of the cost, the attitude and the amenities offered. Not only does this typical persona want to know the information, but they want to know the information now. THey don't want to see lengthy paragraphs or testimonials. They want to see pictures, and an easy-to-understand navigation bar to answer all of their questions. Some important website features to this person is the ability to see pricing and ward information, sign a contract or see other availabilities. </p>
                <p>The goals of this person is most likely to succeed academically but come home to nice roommates, have a nice ward and feel like their house is a home</p>

				<h2>Site Contrast</h2>
				<!--Add paragraphs to address the items in the visitor considerations document-->
				<p>I beleive that brightspace knows who their target audience is. Since the site is created for BYU-Idaho students, they know that most, if not all, people who will be using the site will be students. Their site was created with students in mind, but it is possible that they assumed most students would be using a computer to complete their assignments and work on brightspace</p>
                <p>They didn't mobiley meet the needs of their audience. Their mobile site is even harder to use than their actual site and isn't useful at all for students on the go. If a student is looking at brightspace on their mobile device, it is most likely becasue they are on the go, or do not have access to a computer and need to check a grade or read an assignment. This mobile site doesn't meet this need. It is slow and hard to navigate, if a student wanted to check the status of an assignment it is more worthwhile to just wait until you have computer access</p>
                <p>The content isn't organized on their mobile site. With the small screen it makes it hard to know where you need to go. the "navigation" consists of pixilated pictures and slows down the page even more. Not only are students needing to learn how to navigate the site on a computer, but it is almost impossible to benefit from this mobile site. If you can select a course and find the assignment you are looking for, it is a good start. I think that the main problem that the mobile site is lacking is simplicity and clear display ad navigation to each part of the site. </p>
