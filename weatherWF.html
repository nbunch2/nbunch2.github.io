				<h2>Persona</h2>
                <p>John is a 45 year old business man. He is a college graduate working as a financial advisor. He earns $90,000 a year. He has been working as a financial advisor for over 14 years and has over 20 years of experience in finance.</p>
                <p>John will come to this weather site over sites like the iphone app or other news websites because it has his city and gives information in quick, and clear manner. He accesses the weather on a daily basis right before he goes to bed so that he knows how early he needs to wake up, since he has a long commute and the weather really affects the amount of time it takes for him to get to work.</p>
                <p>John uses computers on a daily basis at work, but it is rare that he uses anything but his mobile device at home or on the go. He doesn't spend more that an hour (outside of work) surfing the web since he wants to spend time with his family. He only surfs the web when he wants to know specific information, and he wants to know it fast. He needs to find the information that will help him and his family, he doens't have much interest in just looking at websites. He wants to be "present" in his home life. He is motivated by the health and safety of his family. </p>

                    <h3> Peer Edit</h3>
                        <p>I had a peer review from Wyatt Larson, this is what he said:</p>
                        <p>I really like how your desktop version of your site shows the weather by cities, each one being separated by its own block. It looks very easy to navigate your website and see the different cities, even in your mobile site which is sometimes harder to do. I think that the only thing I would recommend doing is that while we use the longitude and latitude data in our actual coding of the website, I don't think it would be completely necessary to display it the the user on the site that you developed. Other than that I like the whole design, and I'm a fan of how minimalistic it is! Excited to see it up and running one day.</p>
                        <p>From Wyatts advice I decided to take the longitude and latitude navigation off of my wireframe. I really like what this did to the overall look, especially on my mobile wireframe</p>
